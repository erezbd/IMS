IMS Vision :

Today, small/medium businesses don't have many software option to manage their inventory.
They must work with general software that doesn't fit to their needs.
The business manager don't have to deal with advanced functionality that doesn't relate to him.
So that the reason we chose to develop a easy specific management software for the small stores.
